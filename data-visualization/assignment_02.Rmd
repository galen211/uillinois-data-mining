### Import data
Arxiv HEP-PH (high energy physics phenomenology ) citation graph is from the e-print arXiv and covers all the citations within a dataset of 34,546 papers with 421,578 edges. If a paper i cites paper j, the graph contains a directed edge from i to j. If a paper cites, or is cited by, a paper outside the dataset, the graph does not contain any information about this.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124 months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus represents essentially the complete history of its HEP-PH section.

Data is downloaded from [Stanford's SNAP repositroy](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepPh.html)
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
citations <- read_delim(file.path(dataDir,"cit-HepPh.txt"),
                        "\t", escape_double = FALSE, col_names = FALSE, 
                        trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 4)
colnames(citations)<-c("paper_id","citation_id")
```
